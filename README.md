## What is this?

Hallo! This is a website I made for a conceptual YSWS called HackRoute! It's just to show off some stuff (and also experiment with web dev!)

## Why did you make this?

It was made because I had a concept YSWS, and wanted to make it a reality? If you're interested it's coming soon so yoou'll have to wait for a while.

## How did you make this?

It was made with html, brython (python for the frontend), and Tailwind! Had to read a lot of documentation, and honestly I still dont 100% understand eveyrthing but documentationa nd tutorials all gave me a good starting place!

## What'd you struggle with and what'd you learn?

Struggled alot with divs, flex, and all the quirks of html I suppose. I did learn how to make a somewhat okay website, how to do a marquee, and also tailwind and more web dev!
